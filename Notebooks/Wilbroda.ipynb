    "As a car hire company, understanding the factors influencing fuel efficiency, maintenance costs, and customer preferences is critical to selecting the right mix of vehicles. This project aims to analyze car makes and models using SQL for data extraction and linear regression to identify trends in fuel consumption, engine performance, and other key metrics. By leveraging historical data on vehicle specifications and performance, we can predict which car models align best with our business needs, ensuring a balance between operational costs and customer satisfaction."

    "In the car hire industry, selecting the right vehicles for a fleet is crucial to balancing customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. Car hire companies must choose vehicles that not only meet customer expectations in terms of reliability and comfort but also minimize costs related to fuel, maintenance, and depreciation. With numerous car makes and models available, each with unique specifications and performance metrics, making data-driven decisions becomes essential to avoid costly mistakes in fleet investments.\n",

    "As a data scfientist i have been tasked to analyze historical data on various car makes and models to determine which vehicles are optimal for the car hire company’s fleet. By examining factors such as fuel consumption, engine performance, and other relevant characteristics, we aim to create a model that predicts the best car choices for maximizing profitability and customer satisfaction. Using SQL for data manipulation and linear regression for predictive analysis, we will identify the vehicle types that offer a cost-effective solution while meeting operational and customer needs."
